                    "What is Version Control and Why It Matters": [
                        "Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. It allows developers to keep track of every modification made to the code, saving snapshots at different points in time. This matters because it enables you to revert back to earlier versions if a mistake is made, effectively preventing the loss of work or the overwriting of important code.",
                        "Quick show of hands: who has named files like project.cpp, project-final.cpp, project-final2.cpp? Version control saves us from that little comedy."
                    ],
                    "Git vs GitHub": [
                        "Git and GitHub are connected but distinct tools; Git is the version control software itself, while GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. Git runs locally on your computer to track changes and manage version history. In contrast, GitHub acts as a remote server in the cloud where you can upload your Git repositories to share them with others, facilitate collaboration, and maintain backups.",
                        "If Git is the camera on your phone, GitHub is the shared photo album in the cloud."
                    ],
                    "Importance of Git in Software Development and Team Projects": [
                        "In software development, Git is crucial because it allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. It synchronizes code between different people, ensuring everyone has access to the latest changes and can merge their contributions effectively. Furthermore, Git facilitates the testing of new features on separate branches without breaking the main codebase, which is essential for stable team workflows.",
                        "Remember group projects where someone overwrote your work? Git is the referee that keeps the peace."
                    ]

                    "Installing Git": [
                        "To start using Git, you must first install it on your computer by downloading the appropriate version for your operating system (Windows, Mac OS, or Linux) from the official website. Once installed, you can verify the installation by running the command `git --version` in your terminal or command prompt.",

                        "You can create a GitHub account by navigating to GitHub.com and signing up for free. This account allows you to host your remote repositories, enabling you to back up your local work and collaborate with other developers.",

                    "Configuring Git (username and email)": [
                        "After installing Git, it is necessary to configure your identity so that your commits are correctly attributed to you. You can set your global username and email address by running the commands<br>`git config --global user.email 'your@email.com'`<br>and <br>`git config --global user.name 'Your Name'`.",

                        "A **repository** (or repo) is a folder that contains all your project files and the revision history stored in a hidden `.git` directory. A **commit** is a saved snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time, acting like a save point in a game. A **branch** is a separate line of development that allows you to work on features or fixes in isolation from the main codebase.",
                        "Repo = folder, commit = save point, branch = alternate timeline."

                        "To start tracking a project with Git, you navigate to your project folder in the terminal and run `git init`. This command initializes a new, empty Git repository by creating a hidden `.git` directory, which houses all the internal tracking data for version control.",

                        "The `git status` command is used to inspect the current state of your working directory and staging area. It informs you which files have been modified, which are staged for commit, and which files remain untracked by Git.",
                        "git status is your dashboard; check it often."
                    ],
                    "Staging Files (git add)": [
                        "Staging is an intermediate step where you prepare specific files to be included in the next commit. You use the `git add` command, such as `git add filename` or `git add .` to stage all changes, moving them from the working directory to the staging area.",
                        "Staging is putting items in the cart before checkout."
                    ],
                    "Creating Commits (git commit)": [
                        "Once files are staged, you save a snapshot of the changes to the repository history using the `git commit` command. It is standard practice to include a descriptive message with the `-m` flag, like `git commit -m 'message'`, to explain what changes were made in that snapshot.",
                        "A commit is a snapshot with a label. Keep it short and clear."
                    ],
                    "Understanding the Git Workflow": [
                        "The core Git workflow consists of three main stages: the working directory, where you modify files; the staging area (index), where you prepare changes; and the local repository, where commits are permanently recorded. Developers typically cycle through modifying files, adding them to the stage, and committing them to the repository.",
                        "Draft, stage, save to history. That is the rhythm."
                    ]

                        "To link a local repository to a remote GitHub repository, you use the command `git remote add origin <URL>`, where the URL is provided by GitHub. This establishes a connection that allows you to push local commits to the server and pull remote changes down to your machine.",

                    ],

                        "The `git push` command uploads your local commits to the remote repository on GitHub, updating the online version with your work. Conversely, `git pull` fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and merges them into your local branch, ensuring your code is up to date with your team's work.",
                        "Push = upload, pull = download. Like syncing photos."
                    ],
                    "Understanding .gitignore": [
                        "The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories Git should intentionally ignore and not track, such as build artifacts, temporary files, or sensitive information. This prevents clutter in the repository and ensures that only relevant source code is versioned.",

                    "What are Branches and Why They’re Used": [
                        "Branches are parallel versions of the repository that diverge from the main line of development, allowing you to work on new features or bug fixes safely. They are used to isolate changes so that unfinished or experimental code does not affect the stable, main version of the project.",
                        "Branches are parallel lanes so you can experiment without crashing main."
                    ],
                    "Creating and Switching Branches": [
                        "You can create a new branch using `git branch <name>` or create and switch to it simultaneously with `git checkout -b <name>`. Switching between branches is done using `git checkout <name>` or the newer `git switch <name>`, which updates the files in your working directory to match the selected branch.",
                        "Switch branches like changing tabs; you keep your place."
                    ],
                    "Merging Branches": [
                        "Merging is the process of integrating changes from one branch into another, typically bringing feature work back into the main branch. This is done using the `git merge <branch-name>` command, which combines the history and file changes of the specified branch into the current active branch.",
                        "Merging is bringing the feature lane back into the main highway."
                    ],
                    "Basic Overview of Merge Conflicts": [
                        "A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically resolve differences between two branches, usually because the same line of a file was modified in both. When this happens, Git pauses the merge and asks the user to manually edit the files to choose which changes to keep before finalizing the commit.",
                        "Two people edited the same line, and Git asks you to choose."
                    ]

                    "README Files and Markdown Basics": [
